    <p><h2>Alarn Hotalling | s3916668 | s3916668@student.rmit.edu.au</p></h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Alarn Hotalling. I am 27 years old, Australian born and English is my first and only language. I Graduated year 12 in 2010 and has not advanced my education since – aside from a Cert 3 in Business Administration and various high-risk licenses and courses. My background in employment has predominantly consisted of Construction, Earthworks, Operations and Logistics. I currently work Full-Time as a Dangerous Goods truck driver. One fact that people often find surprising is that despite being really into fishing since leaving high school. I’ve only learned to swim 3 months ago.</p>
    
  <i><p><h3>What is my interest in IT and when did it start?</h3></p></i>

<p>I will be the first to admit, that my interest in IT was a late blooming. Since leaving school, I knew from an early stage of my employment life that the work I was doing was not something I can see myself doing for the rest of my life. Despite knowing this, I didn’t have a clue about what I wanted to do. I knew that I wanted to study University, that much was for certain. For a few years I juggled a few ideas in my head. From Psychology/Philosophy to Physiotherapy and Engineering. After years of umming and uhhring, I finally landed on IT. Mainly because, I want to make an impact and bring meaning to my working life. I always said to myself that, I’d love to have a business. But I never pictured myself as someone who could run a company unless I generally understood and support the products I am trying to promote. After a while of looking for ideas, I finally landed on software and phone applications development. The inspiration came from a Podcast I was listening to on one of my days commuting at work. The guest that was brought onto this particular podcast, was a person named Justin Kan; a co-founder for the streaming platform Twitch. After listening to his story about how he started, it got me thinking about virtual products and the windows of opportunities that it can provide. It wasn’t until this point that I really started exploring the potential of what IT can provide and has since been a key point of interest for me.</p>

<i><p><h3>Why did I choose to come to RMIT?</p></h3></i>

<p>This one has a bit of a back story to it. There have been a few times up until now where I have attempted to start studies with universities local to my town. The first time, I was enrolled in a 16-month part-time tertiary study that was a pre-requisite to gaining access to the Bachelor course I was wanting to study at the time. After a few months, I found it difficult to complete the study due to me not enjoying the topics and quit. I then took up a Diploma in Weight Management in the hopes I could by-pass the pre-requisites and get me into the degree I wanted to study sooner and earn a Diploma while I was at it. Not long into the Diploma until I found out that I was misinformed by my local University and that even with the extra points that a Diploma would provide to my ATAR, I’d still need to sit the tertiary studies to get into the degrees I wanted to study. At the time, this was kind of a kick in the teeth. It wouldn’t be for 6 months later until I would try my option online and stumble across Open University (which, at the time, I thought it was an actual university and was contacting them to ask about their requirements to study with them.) Much to my surprise, they were a company that helps provide a way of gaining access to the degree that I want to study without the tertiary study prior. At the time of hearing this, I was absolutely gob smacked. I had no idea that such an option was available to me this whole time. After talking the fella from Open University and telling him what I would like to study. He suggested me to RMIT.</p>

<i><p><h3>What do I expect to learn in my studies?</p></h3></i>

<p>I will be honest; I don’t really know what to expect. My IT knowledge and experience is very minimal. I didn’t want to jump into something without knowing where to begin and I figured taking this course would be the best way to learn the fundamentals and build from there. I’d expect there to be some focus on coding and understanding the complexity behind it. Apart from that, I’m kind of taking this course as my introduction to a world I’ve neglected for a very long time and am very interested to see what it has to offer me.</p>

<i><p><h3>Ideal Job?</p></h3></i>
<img src="Dream_job_A2.png" alt="Seek Job Application">
<img src="Dream_job_A1.png" alt="Seek Job Application">

<p>There are a few things I find appealing about this job. Despite not being addressed on the add itself, this job was offered to work remotely from home. This is important for me, as I always preferred the freedom that working from home provides. Secondly, this being a brand-new project sparks my interests as I feel like it gives the best opportunity for creative control in the early development of the project. Plus, I have addressed previously that mobile application developments have been my main interests since starting IT. A description in my own words would be contributing to a team environment. Breaking down and scheduling the roles throughout the group. Recommending my take on changes that should be implemented and taking on board other people opinions to make sure the product is the best that it can be. Skills needed will consist of various coding languages, documenting progress, testing and debugging. Familiarisation with iOS, Windows and Android systems.</p>

<p>Right now, my understanding of these system is very green. Outside of the GitHub Tutorials in Week 2 of Introduction to IT, I haven’t had much to do with any coding at all. My work history up until this point have had nothing to do with IT. So, it’s a bit of a mountain to climb, but my way of obtaining these skills (outside of this course) will be through YouTube Tutorial, Learning applications like SkillShare and Brilliant and of course through plenty of practice, trial and error.</p>

<p><h3><i>Big 5</p></h3></i>

<i>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</i>
<br>Honestly, I feel like this test result portrays me incorrectly. But for the sake of the rest of these questions, I will answer based on these results.
<p><i>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</p></i>
<br>Extraversions traits tend to be outspoken and very social. The other 2 highest characteristics are Neuroticism and Openness. Neuroticism have been known to view problems more clearly and realistically while people with Openness traits tend to be good problem solvers. All very important traits in a team environment.
<p><i>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</p></i>
<p><br>I think while forming a team, someone with these skills could very well fall into a leadership role. However, higher Neuroticism have tendencies to be more stressed. This is not inherently a bad thing, it’s just comes down to how well you cope with the stress.</p>

<p><i><h3>Personality and Learning Tests:</p></i></h3>
<p><i>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</p></i>
<br>I think these tests probably reflect me a lot better then the previous. It doesn’t mean a whole lot to me, however. But it was an enjoyable piece to read and reflect on.
<p><i>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</p></i>
<br>An Advocate strength consists of Creativity, Insightfulness, Principles, Passion and Altruism. While my weaknesses are sensitivity to criticism, reluctancy to opening up, Perfectionistic, avoiding the ordinary and being prone to burning out. My learning test shows that I best learn from seeing my work apart from other methods. I think the margin, however, is small enough that I don’t think this will have too big of an affect in a team environment. Back to the personality test, I think  creativity and passion would be great to have in the team, to help stimulate ideas and push passion behind those ideas. The weaknesses in this example, could have some positives too. While perfectionist do tend to procrastinate, if mastered, this trait could really help assure quality results.
<p><i>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</p></i>
<br>I think a person like this would be a good addition to a team, I feel like a place in the team where they can exercise their creativity would be ideal. Based on the project, this could be something like a website designer or something along those lines. 

<i><p><h3>Overview:</p></h3></i>
<p>My Project will be a phone application and website-based software that will provide a foundation for people to build a profile around a long-term career, life or personal goal. Commonly referred to as a X amount year plan, for example, a 5 Year plan etc. This software will provide the user with a tonne of resources to help assist them in building and following a long-term goal like explaining how to plan, structure and break down steps to help achieve the best results. This application will also have a community-based option as well. In which users can make friends, update, reply and like one another status. On top of this, users will have the option to share and view other people’s goals, steps layout and progress. This will help people to find others with similar goals and ambitions.</p>

<i><p><h3>Motivation:</p></h3></i>

<p>My main motivation behind this project is from a personal aspect. I’ve always been someone that craved structure and spent most of my time in the future. Despite this, I was always someone that jumped from idea to idea, and it made the process of planning ahead very difficult for me. I never knew what I wanted to do or even to where to begin looking. My idea of this app is to provide resources to help understand the type of person you are, what you like, what you don’t like and by using these small things as a guide to build a foundation in which you can work from. The community aspect strives from a website called JEFIT. Which is a fitness app in which you can add people, like there workouts and view what they are doing in their training sessions. This in return can help you understand more about their goals, and you can also take inspiration from their training split. I believe this same thing can be strongly beneficial for my application. As a user can use other people goals as a way of understanding more about that person and aligning those goals with their own. This in return can spark a sense of relatability and community. You can also choose to take inspiration from their goals, maybe not everything about their goals aligns with your vision. But you can choose to adapt and redefine your goals.</p>

<i><p><h3>Description:</p></h3></i>

<p>This app will consist of a cloud-base server. In which your data will be stored and accessed from multiple devices. Once you open the application, you will be asked to create a profile. You will then have the option to choose the duration of your goal plan. You’ll start from answering simple questions about yourself and your interests. Your interests will form from a selection of drop-down tags, this will come in play later as you start to explore the social aspect of the app later. After this selection, you will then be answering more direct questions such as, what do you enjoy about your life right now? What can improve and why is this goal important to you? This will be the start of the groundwork to help the user to have a better understanding of their current situation on where to prioritise and what needs work. On top of this, there will be multiple resources provided to the user if they wish to explore further. These resources will consist of various <a href="https://leverageedu.com/blog/types-of-psychological-tests/">personality tests</a>. These tools will only be advised to the user as a guide, as we are all complexed and must allow for some level of ambiguity. The reason I have added these as resources is mainly from personal experience. I believe that too many options and social expectations can have a limiting effect on people beliefs and goals. These tests may help to allow the user to think bigger and broader and to understand from a personal level about what it is that they truly enjoy.</p>
<p>Apart from these resources, there will also be guides on how to effectively plan and break down your goals. These will also be listed in the resources below. The reason I have included this information is because studies has shown that the Medial Prefrontal Cortex (MPFC), the part of the brain that mediates decision making activation levels, lowers significantly if the goal is too future-orientated. This in returns means that smaller steps and goals need to be implemented to provide the best results for long-term success rates.</p>
<p>The application will also involve a library for recommended Podcast, books, videos and scientific data as a source of additional information for the user to explore if she/he wishes. The user will also be given their own library. This will be a place for the user to save and store information from the applications Library into their own space to refer back to at a later date. The user can also outsource their data. The idea behind this implementation is so that the user can utilise this as their own personal index of references and data to help keep the user motivated and on track.</p>
<p>Now that the user has set up her/his account, they might want to try and find like minded people that they wish to connect with. This app allows you to search for people based on the interests selected when setting up your profile. This process helps to make finding friend with similar interests easier. From here, you may want to add them as a friend. Alternatively, you can view their profile to learn more information about them. The information that you see will be determined based on what they choose to display publicly. Everyone will have an option to keep their information private or public. If you were to choose to have their profile set to public, this will allow people viewing your profile to see your goals and progress. If your account was set Private, this information would not be available. Each profile will have the option to have a header. This header will be shown on your online profile in both Private and Public setting. This will be a space where the user can explain a bit about themselves and their ambitions. This is not compulsory but recommended to help allow people to understand more about you.</p>
<p>Once you have become friends, you will now be able to communicate between each other. This communication will consist of back-and-forth text in which you can talk about your goals, share your progress and the content of your library with one another. Once friends, you can also view your friend’s in-depth breakdown on their steps to achieving their long-term goals. This in return might give you insight on how you can manage your own steps or vice versa. As friends, you can also now see each other posts and updates. These updates will show on their feeds every time you complete a goal, notify them of any podcasts or books that you are reading/listening too or when you have posted a status update. From here, they can choose to like or comment on your post.</p>
<p>This in return can help develop friendships and establish a sense of community or higher meaning. There have been numerous studies showing the positive impact that community involvement can have on someone’s mental wellbeing. Apart from well-being, there is also studies supporting the idea that when people work within a community in which everyone shares the same interests and goals, the work ethic and success rate are vastly improved. An example of this in real life, would be a struggling alcoholic going to an AA meeting and overcoming his addiction through the support of people following the same path.</p>

<i><p><h3>Tools and Technologies:</p></h3></i>

<p>Tools required could include GitHub, which will be essential for having a place in which I can work and store my code. Due to the nature of dealing with privacy, I feel there will also be a key importance on cyber security, making sure users personal information is stored correctly and making sure the software continues to runs smoothly. Speaking of which, AJAX would be good to make sure the site runs faster and allow for a more enjoyable user interface. There is plenty more that I would love to elaborate more on. Unfortunately, I’m still trying to wrap my head around all the features and how they work. I look forward to learning more about this as I develop further into this degree.</p>

<i><p><h3>Skills required:</p></h3></i>

<p>Skills required will consist of being well versed in multiple languages such as Java, CSS and HTML5.  Understanding how to transfer these skills across platform between iOS, Android and Windows. Knowing how to debug and perform testing. Good website creativity to enhance the overall appearance of the software to help seem more appealing to the target audience. Business background or experience in marketing to help optimize the best approach to marketing the product. From an outside perspective of all this, a project of this size might also bring out some personal skills. Such as understanding how to best prioritise your time when you work. Being able to work on your problem-solving skills. Be willing to learn and take in new ideas and concepts to help with the growth and development of the project.</p>

<i><p><h3>Outcome:</p></h3></i>

<p>If this project were to succeed, I believe the end product would give people the tools and motivation needed to pursue their goals. I think there are a lot of people out there, that aren’t sure on what they want to do with their lives and don’t know where to begin. I’d like to think that this app will give those people a foundation to get started and promote them to reach out to others in the same boat, and together, they will be able to work towards a more fulfilling life. I think what this app provides that others don’t is structure and variety. Many apps do some, but not all. I believe the key to a good application is one that introduces numerous functionalities. A place where you can store your resources, review your progress, update your progress, adjust changes as you deem fit, find like-minded people, expand on those friendships and feel more involved and excited for your journey by knowing that you can grow as a community.</p>
